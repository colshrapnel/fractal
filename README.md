The aim of this project is to review that shit-mouthed rant called "fractal of a bad design". 
Its points should be reviewed one by one, to be separated into following classes (preferably colored)

- **fair** (red) 
- **dubious** (yellow) - not inherently bad, just a decision
- **fixed** (green) - the criticism was fair, the problem has been fixed
- **bogus** (shit-colored) - subjective statements as "I don't like it", "It's not as in the other language" 

I am in doubts whether "there are more than one way to do it" issues have to be assigned to an existing section or constitute a dedicated section. For the moment I am inclined to mark such statements as "== is useless" or "redundant alt syntax" under **bogus** with an "All right don't use it but leave it alone for the backward compatibility" remark.
